# Attractor Grid (Scale + Reverse)

A single-file web app for teaching attractor fields with a dot grid.


## What it does
- Left-click canvas → add an attractor
- Drag a handle → move it
- Right-click a handle → delete it
- **Scale domain** controls (0–1) instead of pixel radii
- **Reverse** toggle (near → big vs near → small)
- 3-stop color gradient (Low → Mid → High)
- Circles **never overlap** (radius is capped by grid spacing)
- Fixed canvas: **1000 × 1000**
